## Pyhton Final Assignment
# Data Analysis:Bugs 
As the final assignment for the Python class, I selected the task number 3, the data analysis: bugs
I wrote the program on Jupyter Notebook then uploaded it to Github.
You may view the whole program via Github by clicking on the link for Project-1.ipynb file without cloning it.
By clicking on the items listed in the table of content you can easily navigate through the document. Also you'll see some superscripted numbers, these numbers will direct you to theirs corresponding references if you click on them.
However, the table of content and superscripted numbers directed to the references do not work in Github. I have tried the resolve this issue but I couldn't find a proper solution.
Therefore I suggest that you open the program by cloning or downloading it. 
After you clone it you may open it with Jupyter Notebook
I used bugs.csv(as main data) and erotic_art.csv(to test the flexibility of program). These data files were provided by you, so I assume that you have them. Please check if the program and the data files are in the same directory before you run the program. <br>
